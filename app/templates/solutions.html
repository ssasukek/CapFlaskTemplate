            Protecting Areas & Bamboo Corridors
            <br><br>
            <p>The good news is that giant panda numbers are increasing. Slowly but surely this remarkable species is edging away from the brink of extinction - thanks to a host of successful conservation projects. But pandas still face a number of threats, particularly habitat loss and framentation, so extra efforts are needed to ensure that they continue to survive and thrive. Creating new reserves and linking up existing panda populations are key to the species' future. The Chinese authorities have increased the number of panda reserves to 67 in recent years, but this still leaves around 1/3rd of wild pandas outside protected areas. The Chinese government, in partnership with WWF, has also developed bamboo corridors to link pockets of forest, allowing the pandas within them to move to new areas, find more food and meet more potential breeding mates. With panda habitat continuing to be framented by roads, railways and other human development, additional corridors will be need3ed to connect isolated panda populations.</p>

            Conservation & Community Development
            <br><br>
            <p>Simply providing more land for pandas is not enough. Only by effectively addressing the needs of local people and sustainably enhancing their livehoods can we hope to gurantee the long term suvival of the giant panda. The Chinese authorities and WWF have initiated a variety of community development projects in the Minshan and Qinling Mountains, including providing local communities with alternative livelihoods that provide a sustainable income for families while reducing the negative impact of medicinal plant harvesting and poaching, helping people to find a wider market for their locally produced goods, such as honey, pepper, walnuts and potatoes, providing villages with alternative energy sources, such as wood-saving stones and bio-gas from pig manure, so people can cook and stay warm while harvesting less wood from forests, and showing communities how to protect panda habitat without compromising their economic livelihoods by training them in sustainable logging methods, introducing new income-generating activities like ecotourism, and raising awareness about conservation.</p>

            Research & Monitoring
            <br><br>
            <p>The success of panda conservation in recent year and the dedication and determination of the Chinese and impact from working with the governments and universities and other organizations such as the WWF. By spending countless hours monitoring and research helped develope an accurated picture of the pandas current threats, and formulate effective measurements towards panda's decline. Ongoing research and monitoring of pandas are vital to ensure that the conservation becomes successful and not an undermined. Giant panda numbers are put on pandas to identify which panda is which and camera traps are a critical research tool due to pandas in their remote, mountain habitat. The cameras are triggered by movement and help create a more accurate picture of the wild/habitat they live in.</p>
